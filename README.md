CS320 Project

This project incorporates multiple phases of creating an application and testing through J Unit testing within Eclipse.

These files showcase your work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. These files also demonstrate your ability to create unit tests using code to uncover errors, analyze various approaches to software testing based on requirements, and apply appropriate testing strategies to meet requirements.

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
by using various testing techniques, specifically white box and black box methods. THis ensures the tests are meeting requirements and the code is functional and correct.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
By taking your time to understand the requirements placed before you, we can then methodically approach it in a way to develop an efficient and secure system.

How do I approach designing software?
By first understanding the requirements we can get a better understanding on how long a project will take, how many phases of testing is needed, and how we go about developing in general.
